# docker-node

This is a simple repo to demonstrate the use of docker, docker-compose, and basic docker-swarm.

Since this repo is all about Docker and things related to Docker, the Express app (the app built with javascript) was built with minimalistic features and a lot of the best practices I use for building Express apps weren't used. The project is not about Express framework. It's all about Docker.
